# most lists you create will be dynamic meaning you will build a list and then add remove elements from from it
# as your program runs its course for example a game that you create that needs to track the number of montsters 
# on the screen your initial set of monsters can be stored in a list and then as one is destroyed be removed from 
# the list

# modifying elements in a list 
# the syntax for modifying elements in a list is similar to the syntax for accessing an element in a list

# to change an element use the name of the list followed by the index of the element you want to change

# for example we will make a list of motorcycles and we will change an element here is how we would change the value

motorcycles = ['','','']
