# This file contains the basic of list operations in python
# A list is a collection of items in a particular order. You can make a list that includes the letters of the 
# alphabet the digits from 0-9 or the names of all the people in your family
# in all you can put anything you want in a list and the items dont always have to be related in a particular way

# its a good idea to make the name of your list plural 
# in python  [] square brackets indicate a list and individual elements in a list are separated by a comma

# here is a simple example of a list 

# list
bicycles = ['trek','cannondale','redline','specialized']
print (bicycles)
# note that this will print out the whole list brackets and all if you just want the item it self you need to call it
# and access it by its index, note that index positions start at zero and not one
